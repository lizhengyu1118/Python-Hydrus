To understand the temporal persistence of DSL, a ca. 860\u2009km south-north transect was established and soil water content of the 0\u20135\u2009m depth soil layer repeatedly measured for a period of four years. The results indicated that DSL varied with time and had a distribution area over 21.5\u201347.0% in the 860\u2009km transect during the study period. The DSL could be divided into temporary and permanent types based on the length of period for which the soil remains dry. While temporary DSL is recoverable, permanent DSL (which existed in 47 out of 86 sites) was apparently unrecoverable as it persisted throughout the observation period. Permanent DSL was characterized by high temporal persistence, severe soil desiccation and thick dry layers; all of which suggested severe negative effect on the ecosystem. Non-climatic factors, rather than climate factors, contributed more to the formation of permanent DSL in the study area. Thus, it was suggested that policies and measures should be enacted to control especially permanent DSL formation in the region.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038\/s41598-019-38922-y","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,1]],"date-time":"2019-03-01T11:06:43Z","timestamp":1551438403000},"update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":16,"title":["Permanent dry soil layer a critical control on soil desiccation on China\u2019s Loess Plateau"],"prefix":"10.1038","volume":"9","author":[{"given":"Chunlei","family":"Zhao","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Xiaoxu","family":"Jia","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5205-7418","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Kate","family":"Gongadze","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ming\u2019an","family":"Shao","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0221-9009","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Lianhai","family":"Wu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Yuanjun","family":"Zhu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,1]]},"reference":[{"key":"38922_CR1","first-page":"289","volume":"10","author":"YS Li","year":"1962","unstructured":"Li, Y.

After large-scale\nvegetation restoration on the Chinese Loess Plateau, understanding the\nrelationship between vegetation and deep soil moisture has become a\ncrucial focus in current research. In this study, we selected artificial\nforest ( <jats:italic>Pinus tabulaeformis<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Robinia pseudoacacia<\/jats:italic>, and\n<jats:italic>Platycladus orientalis<\/jats:italic>), apple orchard, secondary forest and\nfarmland as the research objects, and native grassland as the control,\nusing soil drilling techniques, we systematically monitored the soil\nwater content of 0-10 m soil layer over two hydrological years, and\nexplore the effects of different vegetation types on soil water\ndeficiency. The results showed that: (1) The deep soil water various\nsignificantly among different vegetation types, which indicating the\ndepth of the influence of vegetation on soil water has reached 10 m. (2)\nThe mean deficit size values of <jats:italic>P. tabulaeformis<\/jats:italic> (0.14), <jats:italic>R.\npseudoacacia<\/jats:italic> (0.17), <jats:italic>P. orientalis<\/jats:italic> (0.07), apple orchard (0.15)\nand secondary forest (0.10) and farmland (0.27) were positive in 0\u20131 m,\nindicating that surface soil water had accumulated during more than half\nof the sampling periods. In the 2\u201310 m soil layer, the mean deficit\nsize was negative in all vegetation types except in farmland, leading to\nsoil desiccation. The deficit size was found to fluctuate with soil\ndepth. (3) Soil water deficit degree was affected by a combination of\nsoil properties and vegetation growth. Altitude, soil bulk density and\ncanopy density had a significant impact on soil water deficit. Our\nresults indicate that the current afforestation model could lead to the\ndeficiency of deep soil water. Therefore, in planning future vegetation\nallocation and management, it is imperative to make reasonable\nvegetation structure according to the available local soil and water\nresources.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.22541\/au.171878825.52482029\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,19]],"date-time":"2024-06-19T09:11:01Z","timestamp":1718788261000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Characteristics of deep soil layer water deficit under different vegetation types of the Loess Plateau, China"],"prefix":"10.22541","author":[{"given":"Jiongchang","family":"Zhao","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Beijing Forestry University"}]},{"given":"Mingshuang","family":"Shen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Changjiang River Scientific Research Institute"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7135-9542","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"jianjun","family":"zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Beijing Forestry University"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4431-2279","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Yang","family":"Yu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Beijing Forestry University"}]}],"member":"311","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,19]],"date-time":"2024-06-19T09:11:01Z","timestamp":1718788261000},"score":31.938475,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.authorea.com\/users\/797458\/articles\/1138496-characteristics-of-deep-soil-layer-water-deficit-under-different-vegetation-types-of-the-loess-plateau-china?commit=f29d838564d02b3e680bd7b891bbbb83731df70b"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,19]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.22541\/au.171878825.52482029\/v1","published":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,19]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"institution":[{"name":"Authorea Inc."}],"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,3]],"date-time":"2025-06-03T16:43:32Z","timestamp":1748969012575,"version":"3.41.0"},"posted":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,6]]},"group-title":"Preprints","reference-count":0,"publisher":"Wiley","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"accepted":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,6]]},"DOI":"10.22541\/au.172291716.67588896\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,6]],"date-time":"2024-08-06T04:06:12Z","timestamp":1722917172000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Characteristics of deep soil layer water deficit under different vegetation types of the Loess Plateau, China"],"prefix":"10.22541","author":[{"given":"Jiongchang","family":"Zhao","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Beijing Forestry University"}]},{"given":"Mingshuang","family":"Shen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Changjiang River Scientific Research Institute"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-7135-9542","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"jianjun","family":"zhang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Beijing Forestry University"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4431-2279","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Yang","family":"Yu","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Beijing Forestry University"}]}],"member":"311","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,6]],"date-time":"2024-08-06T04:06:13Z","timestamp":1722917173000},"score":31.60609,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.authorea.com\/users\/812320\/articles\/1213810-characteristics-of-deep-soil-layer-water-deficit-under-different-vegetation-types-of-the-loess-plateau-china?commit=1f823ce26e4292d397e92aa0f1e1acc229a9ea5a"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,6]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.22541\/au.172291716.67588896\/v1","published":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,6]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,10,12]],"date-time":"2025-10-12T02:19:23Z","timestamp":1760235563975,"version":"build-2065373602"},"reference-count":74,"publisher":"MDPI AG","issue":"9","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,9]],"date-time":"2021-09-09T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1631145600000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/"}],"funder":[{"DOI":"10.13039\/501100001809","name":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["41571218","41401613"],"id":[{"id":"10.13039\/501100001809","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["Forests"],"abstract":"<jats:p>Converting farmland to forest and grassland alleviated water loss and soil erosion. However, water-intensive grasslands and woodlands could form dry soil layers in the arid or semi-arid zones. Therefore, it is necessary to explore a management method to solve this pedological problem. In this study, based on the Environment Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model, the crop productivity and soil dry layer was predicted from 2018 to 2038 in alfalfa and apple land. Then, conservation agriculture and conventional tillage systems were used to repair the soil dry layer in apple and alfalfa systems from 2039\u20132050 in order to explore their potential. Model verification showed that EPIC simulations of yield, ET, and SWC were generally reliable. The predicted results showed that soil drought was more intense in alfalfa systems. Alfalfa\u2019s annual decrease rate and total amount in the soil available water (SAW) were 27.31 mm year\u22121 and 652.76 mm, higher than 13.62 mm year\u22121 and 476 mm of the apple system, and the DSLT of apple\u2019s system was thicker, but DSL-SWC was higher than alfalfa. In the recovery process, the restoration degree of soil desiccation in conservation agriculture was significantly higher than in conventional tillage systems (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the recovery effect increased with the increase of planting times of shallow root crops, such as potato and soybean. The recovery rate was 27.1 \u00b1 1.72 mm year\u22121, DSLT was 750 \u00b1 51.2 cm in conventional tillage systems, and the recovery rate was 44.7 \u00b1 1.99 mm year\u22121, DSLT was 258.3 \u00b1 74.9 cm in conservation agriculture systems.
